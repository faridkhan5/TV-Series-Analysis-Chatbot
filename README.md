## About
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze TV series and create interactive AI experiences. It involves scraping data using Scrapy, extracting series themes with Hugging Face Transformers, building character networks using SpaCy and NetworkX, training a custom text classifier, and creating a chatbot that mimics your favorite characters.
